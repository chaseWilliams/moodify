        <p>Hey! Welcome to Moodify, the painless solution for making Spotify playlists.</p>
        <p> Aren't you tired of spending hours hand-tagging songs that belong in so-and-so playlists?
        The pain of having to continually update your playlists lest they fall into disrepair,
        missing the songs you listen to the most?  </p>
      </div>

        <p> At last, salvation is nigh. </p>
        <p> Moodify will create playlists for you, using nothing but your library and some careful input
        by you. After telling it a little detail about how you categorize songs, it will break up
        your songs into five different playlists: Depressed, Excited, Aggressive, Relaxed, and Cheerful.
        After that, you can check out those auto-generated playlists and add any of them to your Spotify account.</p>
        <p> But Moodify is so much more than that. Not only will it create playlists of different "moods" so to speak,
        it also has the ability to create other kinds of playlist depending on your wishes. Have you ever wanted a
        playlist that had just one genre in it? Maybe all of your rock and roll, or all of your pop songs?
        What about the most popular songs you have, that everyone is sure to have heard? Or, the songs you
        personally listen to a lot?</p>
        <p>Why, with Moodify, you can even make nostalgic playlists, composed of your frequently played songs from,
        say, last summer.</p>
        <p> Moodify: your best friend when it comes to making playlists.</p>
        <i> Disclaimer: You need not only a Spotify account, but also a Last.fm account for full functionality.</i>
